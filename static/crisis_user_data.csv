13.25,-61.19,Hurricane Beryl - Jun 2024,"<p>Tropical cyclone Beryl has become a major hurricane forecast to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane headed toward the Windward Islands (Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Martinique). On 29 June evening, Beryl was about 960 km/h east-southeast of Barbados with maximum sustained winds of near 136 km/h, moving west at around 30 km/h. Maximum sustained winds of 129 – 177 km/h or greater, rainfall accumulations of 100 to 150mm, very rough and hazardous marine conditions and storm surges are expected across St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with possible higher winds offshore. Large and destructive waves/swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. The government of St Vincent and the Grenadines has urged the population to gather emergency supplies. Shelters are to be accessible by 6 p.m. local time today. Volunteers are active in their various communities, checking the vulnerable population and assisting families preparing for the event.

<p>Hurricane Beryl, the earliest hurricane to reach category five intensity in the Atlantic Ocean, has caused unprecedented devastation across the Caribbean, making its destructive path through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Dominica, Barbados, and Jamaica...The storm first impacted Barbados, causing severe damage to the south coast and significantly affecting the fishing industry, with over 200 fishing vessels damaged or destroyed. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 90 percent of infrastructure has been damaged, including houses, roads, and the airport terminal on Union Island. Communication with the Southern Grenadines remains disrupted, and access to basic services is still limited...While in Grenada, Beryl made landfall in Carriacou as a Category 4 hurricane, damaging 95 percent of homes in Carriacou and Petite Martinique. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4075316"">IFRC, 4 Jul 2024</a>)</p>
<p>According to the 5 July Government Gazette, the parishes of Saint Patrick, Carriacou and Petite Martinique have been declared disaster zones from 1 July to 30 September 2024. The Damage and Needs Assessment (DANA) team confirmed that all data for Grenada should be finalized by 16 July. Currently, only the assessment for St. David is pending completion. Road blockages and assessment fatigue among residents are causing delays. The full extent of damage in Mayreau and Canouan remains unknown due to telecommunication issues, but similarly severe damage is expected. Bequia in the northern Grenadines sustained less damage. As Mayreau is far from the mainland, it is accessible only by a two-hour boat trip from St. Vincent. Although some aid is expected to trickle in from nearby islands, needs are widespread, and the aid is only guaranteed for the short term. An estimated 1,000 people remain in public shelters, a figure that does not account for those in private homes. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4076720"">OCHA, 9 Jul 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Nearly a month after Hurricane Beryl, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are still recovering and focusing on rebuilding and restoring essential services. The Government, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), UN agencies, and international organizations are working together to provide essential services, medical care, and support rebuilding efforts. Both countries face challenges in logistics, resource allocation, and rebuilding to withstand future hurricanes, especially with the peak of hurricane season approaching. Both Governments are prioritizing restarting the economy and improving disaster preparedness while addressing immediate needs and long-term recovery.

28.25,83.94,Nepal: Floods and Landslides - Jun 2024,"<p>Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4069831"">IFRC, 12 Jun 2024</a>)</p>
<p>The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September). (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4069831"">IFRC, 12 Jun 2024</a>)</p>
<p>The monsoon season is impacting several parts of Nepal, causing floods, triggering landslides and resulting in casualties and damage.

15.61,-90.39,Guatemala: Dengue Outbreak - May 2024,"<p>Dengue continues to be the arbovirus with the highest number of reported cases in the Americas region, with outbreaks occurring on a cyclical basis every 3 to 5 years. During the year 2024 between epidemiological weeks (SE, for its acronym in Spanish) 1 and 16 of 2024, a total of 6,769,140 suspected cases of dengue were reported (cumulative incidence of 717 cases per 100,000 population). This ígure represents an increase of 206% compared with the same period in 2023 and 387% compared with the average for the last 5 years (1).<br />
On 16 February 2024, in view of the exponential increase in dengue cases observed in the írst weeks of the year in several countries of the Region of the Americas, PAHO made an urgent appeal to Member States. The organization emphasized the need to intensify vector control measures and to maintain active surveillance, ensuring early diagnosis and timely treatment of cases (2).<br />
On 7 March 2024, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS, for its acronym in Spanish) of Guatemala, through the Directorate of Epidemiology and Risk Management, issued an epidemiological alert for dengue (3). This alert was established to reinforce dengue control and prevention plans, based on data accumulated up to epidemiological week 7, which ended on 17 February. As of that date, a total of 6,760 cases of dengue fever had been recorded this year, of which 31 were severe cases resulting in 3 deaths. The decision to issue this alert was motivated by the beginning of the high dengue transmission season in the country. As part of this measure, specific epidemiological surveillance actions were reinforced, including standardized protocols for the detection, notiícation, and registration of cases in hospitals and health areas.  (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4064985/"">IFRC, 25 May 2024</a>)</p>
<p>On 27 June, at a meeting of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the national level, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPAS) verbally requested the National Society to replace the intervention in the department of Suchitepequez with that of Zacapa. This request was based on the significant increase of dengue cases in Zacapa and a considerable decrease in Suchitepequez. The request was made in response to evidence of the most affected areas and the shortage of personnel and resources needed by SPAS to address the national dengue emergency.<br />
Up to the 34th epidemiological week, 80,234 cases of dengue fever have been reported in the country. According to the same report, 14 of the 29 Departmental Directorates of Integrated Health Services Networks (DDRISS) reported an incidence of dengue that exceeds the national average. Among the most affected departments are Jutiapa, Santa Rosa, Zacapa, El Progreso, Baja Verapaz, Sacatepéquez, Quetzaltenango, Retalhuleu, Jalapa, Escuintla, Suchitepéquez, Chiquimula, and the northwestern and northeastern areas of Guatemala.

A record mid-season dry spell has affected vast parts of the region including, Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe ... The evolving drought crisis in Southern Africa is expected to continue to worsen already dire food insecurity levels, further driving malnutrition and spreading diseases like cholera. Reports indicate that the impact of these dry conditions in Southern Africa is likely to be long-lasting, with FEWS NET projections indicating the possibility of elevated needs for food assistance during the lean season in early 2025.

-22.21,24.32,Botswana: Drought - May 2024,"<p>On May 24, 2024, the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development issued a report urging support due to the devastating impact of drought on food security drivers, nutrition, water supplies, and food production. The report highlighted a signicant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23. Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production, disrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing signicant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems.
The country has experienced dry spells and rainfall decits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in July 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been categorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024.
The El Niño drought effect in Southern Africa has further exacerbated the already critical drought situation. According to the Southern Africa Seasonal Monitor report, Botswana is currently experiencing El Niño conditions, leading to severe rain deficits and challenging harvest conditions across most of the region, with dry spells expected to persist.

The Ministry of Blue Economy and Disaster Risk Management informed that the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) had been responding to reports of wildfires affecting the village of San Pedro Columbia and adjacent communities in the Toledo District. Initial assessments were conducted, and a plan of action was created to provide immediate humanitarian support to affected families. NEMO maintained contact with the chairpersons and alcaldes of San Pedro Columbia, Crique Jute, Mafredi, and San Antonio. Aerial reconnaissance was conducted on May 17th to confirm the extent of the fire, determine the initial damage assessment, and assist in plans to contain the fire. Based on this initial assessment and as a result of the wildfires affecting the community of San Pedro Columbia and adjacent communities in the Toledo District, the Ministry of Blue Economy and Disaster Risk Management and the NEMO informed that a proclamation declaring a state of public emergency for the district was signed by the Governor General on May 19. On May 20, the Government of Belize halted classes in localities of the country that had been affected by forest fires and suffered heavy environmental pollution due to this cause. The Ministry of Education declared the measure for all schools in the Toledo district and considered the action necessary due to the poor air quality in that area. Several local media reports document the extent of damage the fires have caused within the Toledo District. According to two media outlets, around one hundred farmers have lost their entire farms. The fires that swept through several communities in the Toledo District have left significant losses in their wake. The fires became a threat to the communities as they threatened farms in several Maya villages, starting in San Pedro, Columbia. The Belize Defense Force’s Cadenas Outpost near Graham Creek had also been consumed by the fires. Deputy Commander of the Belize Defense Force, Colonel Anthony Velasquez said the soldiers had to abandon the post.

According to media reports, every one in five Namibians is considered food insecure. Against the backdrop of scarce rains, over 331,000 households have already registered for the government-funded drought relief programme to assist the affected communities. This programme amounts to EUR 40 million but it currently has a funding gap of EUR 25 million. At the extraordinary summit held on 20 May by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to discuss the El Niño-induced drought and floods affecting member states, the Namibian President called for assistance from SADC countries and the International Community at large to bridge the above-mentioned funding gap. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4065957"">ECHO, 29 May 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Between April and June 2024, an estimated 1.2 million people (40 percent of the analysed population) in Namibia face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods. These are the most vulnerable groups (unemployed, marginalized communities, those with no national documents to benefit from social safety nets, children under the age of five, pregnant and breastfeeding women and pensioners) in both urban and rural areas. This number has more than doubled from 491,000 people (19 percent of the population analysed) which were projected to be facing acute food insecurity during the period under review in the July 2023 analysis.The entire country (all 14 regions) is classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and need action for livelihood protection. Namibia’s deteriorating food security is mainly driven by the impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, climatic shocks, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4076162"">IPC, 8 Jul 2024</a>)</p>
<p>During the current period of analysis, from July to September 2024, 1.15 million people in Namibia (38 percent of the analysed population) face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods; all the 14 areas of analysis are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). This represents an improvement compared to what was projected in the last July 2023 analysis, where 1.44 million people (48 percent) were expected to face high levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) for the same period (July-September 2024). While the main assumption on the impact of El Nino was adjusted, the deterioration of the food security situation is still linked to the negative impact of El Nino on crop and livestock production, price shocks, economic decline and unemployment. In the first projection period (October 2024 – March 2025), the food security situation is expected to worsen due to the start of the lean season, and seasonal price increases, where 1.26 million people (41 percent of the analysed population) are expected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above.

-18.09,34.75,Mozambique: Drought - May 2024,"<p>As vast parts of southern Africa grapple with an unprecedented mid-season dry spell, the food security situation in Mozambique continues to deteriorate. The compounded effects of El Niño, above-average temperatures, extreme weather events such as Tropical Storm Filipo, excessive floods, coupled with the lasting impact of past shocks such as Tropical Cyclone Freddy, are exacerbating the situation. The 2023-2024 El Niño has been one of the strongest on record, bringing below-average rainfall between October 2023 and February 2024 in southern and central Mozambique, and average to above-average rainfall to the northern part of the country. This disruption continues to impact agriculture and rural livelihoods. Between November 2023 and February 2024, typically the rainy season in Mozambique, the southern and central regions of the country experienced persistent dryness and unusually high temperatures, and many areas received less than half of their typical rainfall. These events in turn led to deteriorating vegetation conditions and crop wilting in parts of the central provinces. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4065342"">IFRC, 27 May 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Around 20 million people reside in areas that have now been hit by drought, 2.7 million of whom were already struggling with food insecurity (IPC3+) before the onset of El Niño.

<p>Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to prevail from June to September 2024 in the El Niño-induced drought and conflict-affected areas of Mozambique due to poor harvests, limited income-earning opportunities, and failure to engage in normal livelihoods activities. In addition to these shocks, above-average food prices will make it difficult for poor and very poor households to access food from the markets. In Cabo Delgado, several areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance will likely be facing Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to expand
between October 2024 and January 2025, mainly in the country's central region. The impact of the lean season, which includes the rapid depletion of below-average food stocks for families who were able to harvest some of their own crops, combined with above-average food prices and below average income, will lead to an expansion of areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, particularly in areas affected by the El Niño-induced drought.

12.11,-61.68,Grenada: Drought - May 2024,"<p>On May 10, 2024, [...] The Government of Grenada officially declared a water crisis due to an acute shortage of water resources. Effective from May 12, 2024, stringent water usage restrictions were enforced across the island. These measures aim to curb wasteful practices and encourage responsible water management during this critical period. The declaration and ensuing water restrictions was prompted by a combination of prolonged drought conditions, insufficient rainfall, and aging water infrastructure. Collectively, this led to critically low water levels in reservoirs. The government implemented several emergency measures to manage the crisis and mitigate its impacts on the population. The 2024 water crisis in Grenada is noted as the most severe in 14 years. This crisis is marked by unprecedented low water levels, significant water rationing, and stringent restrictions on water usage for non-essential activities. The declaration highlighted the extreme nature of the drought and the urgent need for conservation and improved water management strategies to ensure the availability of safe drinking water for the island's residents. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4064984/"">IFRC, 24 May 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Although recent rains have slightly alleviated the situation, water supplies remain insufficient. Farmers are struggling with dry conditions, leading to crop failures and food shortages. Meanwhile, a heatwave has worsened conditions, causing bush fires and exacerbating water shortages. In response, the Grenada Red Cross, supported by the IFRC, is working with the National Water and Sewage Authority to assist the affected population. Despite immediate relief efforts, the water crisis is expected to persist until the peak of the next rainy season.  (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4070550/"">OCHA, 14 Jun 2024</a>)</p>

A person infected with 'circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2' (cVDPV2) was confirmed. Although a polio outbreak had already been declared by the government on February 27th, 2024, due to environmental samples found in the provinces of Luanda and Huambo, the case on May 3rd was the first human case reported. The Government of Angola has classified the current outbreak as a Grade 2 emergency (i.e., moderate level – aligned with WHO classification) due to the high risk of virus spread, exacerbated by poor water and sanitation infrastructure and hard-to-reach populations. Additionally, there is an increased risk of cross-border transmission along the DRC-Angola border, with genetic sequencing indicating a link to a polio virus reported in the DRC's Cassai Oriental province, classified as cVDPV2 (Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2).

The two Care Centers established in Wabag and Mulatika will be developed to host increased displaced populations. Damage to a major road is impeding fuel and food supplies from Wabag to landslide-affected areas. The security situation in the disaster area remains volatile due to competition for resources, pre-existing inter-communal tensions and pervasive gender-based violence; the first serious security incident was reported on 13 June.

<p>Following the landslide in Enga Province in May, the Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) has been alerted to imminent threats at the Mulitaka Landslide area by emergency response and geotechnical teams on site. Assessments indicate ongoing geo-seismic activity and potential hazards threatening communities within the Mulitaka Landslide Disaster Site and the Disaster Management Emergency Care Center. Bulges, cracks on the road and fault lines on the high ground have been observed, indicating the imminent risk of further landslides. Immediate evacuation and resettlement of the Care Center are recommended. The Enga Provincial Disaster Office (EPDO) issued the new direction to be immediately implemented for the Provincial Disaster Management Committee (PNGDF), Police, and UN agencies to coordinate evacuations, restrict access to the site, and identify new settlement areas. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4072993/"">OCHA, 26 Jun 2024</a>)</p>
<p>The landslide caused extensive damage to many lives, homes and livelihoods. The extent of the destruction has left an estimated 1,680 individuals displaced, with an estimated 3,979 individuals affected and at risk of displacement. Furthermore; 9,952 individuals are estimated to be directly affected by the landslide. Immediate emergency response and long-term recovery plans are crucial to address the needs of these affected populations and mitigate future risks and vulnerabilities. The landslide has not only devastated the Yambali ward but also caused significant instability in the surrounding area. The soil remains highly unstable, with visible cracks indicating imminent threats to lives and properties. Ongoing geo-seismic activities in the vicinity exacerbate the risk, as the land continues to shift. The landslide covered two creeks with debris and boulders, blocking waterways and increasing the likelihood of further slides. The blockage of these creeks poses a critical risk of flooding, which could trigger additional landslides, endangering the already vulnerable community.

-29.58,28.24,Lesotho: Drought - Apr 2024,"<p>According to the weather update for quarter 1 of 2024 issued by the Lesotho Meteorological Services, the persistent heatwaves and exceptionally high temperatures experienced between January and March 2024 have led to widespread dryness of crops across most fields. The continuous crop failures over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hands, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity. Approximately, 325,000 individuals are experiencing the ramifications of the ongoing food insecurity based on IPC information, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately 22% of the population. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas. In these districts, access to adequate food and nutrition is severely compromised, necessitating urgent intervention and support measures to alleviate the hardship faced by affected communities. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4063043"">IFRC, 17 May 2024</a>)</p>
<p>A below-normal harvest and increased market reliance have resulted in maize prices rising during the main harvest. Although a larger area was planted in the 2023/24 than the previous season, dry conditions damaged much of the crop between January and March, especially maize. Some poor and very poor households that experienced significant crop losses are already relying on food purchases from local markets, which is earlier than normal. Retail staple food prices are expected to increase further due to below-average local production and higher prices for imported maize. Consequently, household purchasing capacity is expected to decline, particularly between August and September, when market purchases are the main food source, and labor opportunities are often seasonally limited. Overall, most households are likely to continue to meet their food needs through September, driving area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes.

These populations require urgent humanitarian action to reduce their food consumption gaps, protect and restore their livelihoods and prevent high levels of acute malnutrition. An additional 6.7 million people are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) between the same period and require interventions to mitigate disaster risks and safeguard their livelihoods. Most of the population in Phase 3 or above are not able to produce enough of their own food and are dependent on market purchases for their food needs. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate during the projection period from October 2024 to March 2025 which coincides with the lean season in Malawi. The resulting impact of El Niño on crop production will exacerbate the situation further and is likely to result in an earlier onset of the lean season. In this projected period, 5.7 million people (28 percent of the analysed population are estimated to be in IPC Phase 3 or above).

This event primarily impacted the Marshall Islands, particularly the Roi Namur Islet in the northern sector of Kwajalein Atoll, which is part of the US Military base. Notably, this incident involved weather-driven waves and inundation, distinct from a tsunami.</p>
<p>The powerful winds associated with the storm system generated a substantial swell that affected Roi-Namur and other areas such as Arno Atoll and the runway in Ailinglapalap. There are suspicions that additional islands and atolls (namely: Jaluit, Arno, Namu, Alinglaplap, Wotje, Jabot, Namdrik, Kili, Kwajalein) may have been affected, although ground reports are limited and experiencing delays due to communication and infrastructure challenges.</p>

46.84,103.08,Mongolia: Dzud - Dec 2023,"<p>Mongolia is currently facing a severe Dzud. This slow-onset disaster is unique to Mongolia and results from summer droughts followed by heavy snowfalls and extreme cold, leading to insufficient grazing pastures and hence underfed animals resulting in increased livestock mortality. As of 30th December 2023, over 90% of the country has been affected by extreme Dzud conditions, with 160 soums across 20 provinces being identified as high-risk areas. Over 258,000 people, including 100,000 children (51,000 girls and 49,000 boys) are affected due to roads blocked by snow, preventing children from accessing vital health, nutrition, education and protective services. Herder families, who are most directly impacted by the Dzud, often have to leave their children in the care of relatives or at boarding schools, increasing protection risks and causing psychological stress. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4032456"">UNICEF, 25 Jan 2024</a>)</p>
<p>As a result of the Dzud, the number of livestock losses increased from 49,000 in November 2023 to 284,242 by 26 January 2024. The Otor Movement is a nomadic practice of domestic herders migrating to seek pasture: From early November 2023, 18,859 herder families (67,892 people) have been on the Otor Movement. As of January 2024, 7,570 families moved to the state-protected area (the Mongolian government is using its last pasture resort, where settlement is prohibited because there are endangered plants and animals under State protection), 2,322 families moved to other provinces, 4,303 families moved within their province, 2,907 moved to the border, 1,047 moved to the provincial border (in and out between 2 provinces), and only 710 families moved in soum borders. While the Otor movement is beneficial for livestock, it requires tremendous efforts from herder families to frequently relocate, forcing them to live in roughly built shelters and being isolated from basic services. The intensity of the dzud is impacting those on the Otor Movement more than in previous years, and the number of people on the Otor Movement is higher than in previous years.

<p>[...]  According to the Dzud Map produced by NAMEM on 26 February 2024, 76 per cent of the country is currently affected by white and ice/Iron Dzud types. Several additional key factors have contributed to the escalation of the Dzud to an exceptional level this winter: numerous blizzards since November 2023, extensive snow coverage across the country, and fluctuating temperatures with periods of intense cold/freezing, followed by warm phases/snow melting, and then refreezing, leaving no grazing options for livestock (sheep, cows, horses, and camels). Consequently, hay and fodder stocks had to be utilised a few months earlier than in usual winters. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), established by the government of Mongolia last December, has reported a rapid increase in livestock mortality from the second half of February 2024, with the latest official figures as of 14 March 2024 indicating over 4,7 million dead animals (compared to 612,000 dead animals on 21 February). This represents 7 per cent of the national livestock (up from 0.94 per cent on 21 February). While the numbers are increasing fast, this situation is already twice as critical as last year's Dzud, and the government estimates that this year will be far more severe than the worst Dzud recorded in 2010. On 14 February 2024, the Government of Mongolia passed a resolution declaring a heightened readiness level until 15 May due to the severe Dzud affecting the country nationwide (priority support and involvement in crisis management, at all governmental levels). According to EOC figures, as of the end of February, 185,937 herder households, constituting 75 per cent of all herder households, have been directly or indirectly affected by the Dzud’s impacts. About 100,000 herder families are considered the most vulnerable households. As of 7 March 2024, 1,344 herders have lost their entire livestock, and 18,859 herder families are currently on the Otor movement (a nomadic winter coping mechanism used in past years by herder communities in Mongolia to provide livestock access to pasture).

<p>The situation has escalated significantly compared to previous years, with March 2024 witnessing conditions twice as severe as the last dzud event, and the worst since 2010. Current livestock mortality rates have already soared to 8.1% of 64.7 million livestock, with 2,257 herder households having lost more than 70% of their livestock. The severity of the situation has prompted a revision of the Dzud Response Plan for 2023/2024, which complements the Government of Mongolia’s planned response. The plan revised by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) now aims to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance to 76,000 people out of the 200,000 people in need identified by the HCT through a coordinated approach with early warning and early action to respond to needs triggered by the Dzud. (<a href=""https://reliefweb.int/node/4049776"">OCHA, 26 Mar 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Health concerns are escalating, with restricted food availability leading to nutritional deficiencies among herder households. [...] The remote location of many herder families, combined with a lack of fuel and prioritization of livestock over healthcare, severely limits access to medical services, which are available at the provincial and soum levels. [...] The need to dispose of more than five million animal carcasses is urgent, as yellow floods are expected with spring temperatures set to melt an exceptional amount of snow this year.

Twenty people, including two children, have lost their lives due to severe blizzard. The dzud has mostly affected herder households, whose main/sole income source for livelihood is livestock. As of 25 April 2024, 4957 herder households had lost more than 70 per cent of their livestock and the country has lost 7.1 million livestock, amounting to 11.1 per cent of the total.

<p>Official estimates indicate that about 7.9 million heads of livestock perished due to the 2023/24 Dzud, with the highest losses occurring in Sukhbaatar, Khentii, Arkhangai, Tuv and Dornogovi provinces (locally known as aimags) located in the eastern and central parts of the country. The death toll accounts for 12.3 percent of the national herd, significantly exceeding the average mortality rate recorded during the same period in the previous five years and is the highest level since 2010. The loss of livestock has a direct negative effect on the income of a large number of people in the country as over a quarter of the total population is engaged in livestock‑rearing activities. Reduced income and high prices of staple foods are expected to erode the purchasing power of most vulnerable herder households, constraining their access to food.
